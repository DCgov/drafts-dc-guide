**Can documents on the DC Register be cross-posted on Drafts DC?**

Drafts DC is great for posting drafts of documents as they are being developed, but it's also useful and appropriate to post a copy of policy documents in conjunction with posting them officially to the DC Register. In this context, comments received via Drafts DC during the official public comment period should be treated no differently than comments received via mail, email, or other channels.
