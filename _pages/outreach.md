The key to using Drafts DC successfully is to remember that simply posting your document does not guarantee that anyone will read it, nor does it guarantee a diverse or representative body of commenters. It is your responsibility to plan how to reach those most affected by your document and help them make their voices heard.

Here's how:

* Who are you trying to solicit input from? Make an audience list of 3-5 key groups/demographics.
  * Consider key stakeholder groups, residents you don't usually hear from, and residents that may have a unique perspective on your document.  For example, Ban the Box related materials might benefit from input from the small local business community, from social service providers, and from returned citizens themselves.
  * How can you reach your audiences?  Think in terms of "channels" â€” Drafts DC is your web channel. Can your audiences be reached via social media? In person events? Direct mail?
* Plan your comment period:
  * How many weeks should the document be open for comments?  A good starting point is one month.
  * Per your outreach strategy, what specific outreach activities should take place before, during, and after the comment period?
  * During the comment period, who specifically will be responsible for monitoring Drafts DC and providing comment moderation and answer questions?
  * Once the comment period closes, who specifically will be responsible for reviewing and responding to the comments?
* When it is ready, [post your document](posting.html). Remember that it doesn't need to be perfect. The point of Drafts DC is to bring residents into the conversation early, so provisional content is acceptable.
  * Remember to set expectations clearly. If ideas are truly provisional or exploratory, state that clearly to help the public understand how to interpret them.
