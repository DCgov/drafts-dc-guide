So you're ready to post a document on Drafts DC? Fantastic! Posting is easy, and we're here to support your team every step along the way.

If this is your first time posting to Drafts DC, email [drafts@dc.gov](mailto:drafts@dc.gov) to request an account on the site. Regardless of whether you've done this before, our team is available to consult with you and guide you through the process.

## Formatting your document

Some documents are a better fit for Drafts DC than others. The platform is intended primarily to support collaboration on text. Documents that probably won't be productive to post to Drafts DC include presentations, spreadsheets, or multimedia materials.

For this reason, the formatting options on the platform are deliberately limited. Documents are posted in the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) format, which enables headings, section dividers, bulleted and numbered lists, bold and italics, and links. In addition, the platform supports raw HTML to create tables or more complex formatting, but this should be limited to where absolutely necessary.

To add your document to the site, log into [Drafts DC](https://drafts.dc.gov/), and on your account page, click "Create Document." If your text is currently in Microsoft Word, you can speed up the formatting process by using [this free tool](http://word-to-markdown.herokuapp.com/) to convert from a Word file to Markdown. Then copy and paste the text into the Drafts DC editor, and use the preview window to confirm that the document is formatted correctly.

## Checklist

* Another member of your team should proofread the document on Drafts DC to ensure that no errors have been accidentally introduced. By setting the Publish State to "Private," a link to the document can be shared internally.
* The introductory text is an important opportunity to set expectations for the document. If the ideas are provisional or exploratory, state that clearly to help the public understand how to interpret them.
* Drafts DC also allows you to add "events" to the document. At a minimum, these should include the date on which comments will close. They might also include public meetings or other significant milestones.
