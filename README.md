## Drafts DC Guide

[Drafts DC](https://drafts.dc.gov/) is a website that enables government and residents to collaborate on text documents. Residents can express support or opposition to a document and leave comments about it. These comments are publicly visible, which enables a real-time conversation between residents and government, and can be attached to individual paragraphs of the document, which enables the conversation to focus on specific details.

Posting a document to Drafts DC tells the public that you want feedback and will be paying attention to and engaging with those who provides it. Drafts DC is a place for documents that are being actively developed, not an archive. It does not replace the [DC Register](http://dcregs.dc.gov), although many documents that are posted to the Register could also benefit from being made available on Drafts DC.

It's important to understand that simply posting a document to the site does not guarantee that the public will comment on it. Agencies must plan public engagement — online and off — to invite residents and organizations to participate.
